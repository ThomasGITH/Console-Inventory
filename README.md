# Console-Inventory
A simple inventory visually represented by ASCII characters. The '~' character represents empty space, while the other characters represent items. The items get sorted from most valuable to least valuable.

### What I've learned from this task
I didn't actually know about the 'std::sort()' function before since I've never had need for it. I also learned to more efficiently use 'std::vector' by reserving space, rather than using the 'push_back' function from the start.
